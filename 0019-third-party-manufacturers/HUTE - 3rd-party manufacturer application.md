## Customer Support
We can provide customer support via:
* Discord’s Vendor channel.
* 7 * 24 hours customer enquiry.
* FAQ section for customer to search the answers of their issues.
* The hardware maintenance service will be one year free for labor cost, provided hardware replacement if the breakdown of hardware comes from itself
* The software issues could be solved by SSH remote access or OTA upgrade.

## Hardware Security
Lkt4200 encryption chip uses swarm key storage, it has high performance and low power 32-bit CPU core, instruction support standard C, 64 ~ 420k byte flash, can be used as program storage area and data memory flexibly. The embedded true random number generator meets fips140-2 standard; The frequency range of external clock is 1-10mhz; Support UART interface, and the maximum communication rate is more than 1Mbps; The communication rate is much higher than the encryption chip based on 8-bit smart card chip.
* Voltage detection module against high and low voltage attacks, Frequency detection module against high and low frequency attacks.
* High voltage and low voltage sensors, frequency sensors, filters, pulse sensors, temperature sensors. It has the function of sensor life test.
* When the chip detects illegal detection, it will start the internal self destruction function.
* Chip tamper proof design, unique serial number.
* Bus encryption, with metal shielding layer, internal data self destructs when external attack is detected.
* Hardware 3DES algorithm coprocessor.
* MMU memory management unit, which can set sys / APP mode and grant corresponding permissions.
* The program and data are encrypted.
* The goal of security certification is eal5 +.

## Manufacturing Information
We have been working with a large number of hardware suppliers, so we can get raw materials quickly.We will continue using these manufacturers for producing Helium Hotspot Miner and Helium Light Gateway.

## Budget & Capital
We will arrange the production plan according to the customer's demand. We plan to produce at least 15000 units by 2021. We are prepared with sufficient funds for this.

## Risks & Challenges
We will provide the best service for the vast number of users in China. We can expand the market quickly.

Another thing, our factories are all in mainland China, there may be possible delay in transportation and maintenance of our products. We are planning to establish cooperation with international courier service should the proposal goes well.
